				This bacterial strain was initially identified by its distinctly pink color. For this reason, pink was incorporated into the poster design. Another added benefit of the bright pink and the bold font was the context. This poster was presented at a regional conference where we needed to compete for attention with other posters, and we found that this strong imagery helped to draw people in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A challenge faced in this poster is that we had many assays in which we compared the growth of bacteria with other bacteria. To show all these results, we had more than ten pictures squeezed into the middle of the poster. They were so crowded and small that it was difficult to see the most relevant results. All but a few of the results were positive, so this was solved by including the positive test results and examples of negative test results. To present all the research, the results for every test were shared in a table immediately below the pictures.

				When designing this poster, I considered the flow of the reader through the poster. For this  reason, I chose the simple three-collumn approach.
			</p>
			<p>
				I previously noticed that oftentimes when there is a block of text in the middle of a poster underneath the title, the overall poster feel congested. With a mass of text in the middle, the viewer does not have a clear place to settle their eyes. I remedied this with pictures of the cultures, to give the eye a resting place and quickly orient the reader. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To the left and right of the title, I include pictures of fruits so that without reading the poster, one could get an idea of the topic. The images of fruit ground the abstract chemical name: "Octyl Acetate" in their scent, and the images of bacterial cultures tell the reader that this poster is about bacteria. In the rest of the poster, I use figures to break up text and organize whitespace all while conveying key information.
