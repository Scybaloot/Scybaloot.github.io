                <li>
                  Curry learns better when she engages in conversations with other students, and that can be lacking in online courses that don't have forums or collaboration built in.

            <p class="lead">
              Answers in Authess are based on problem-solving approaches, so Grant can still get credit for what steps he followed correctly. Because questions are not limited to multiple-choice, tests are more difficult to cheat on.

              Value Proposition for Curry
            </h3>
            <p class="lead">
              Authess' questions are based on ways of thinking and concepts, so Authess’ approach to assessment aligns with Curry’s learning goals. Curry could be an early-adopter for this reason and might be worth focusing on.

              Before the research, it seemed that the users contradicted each other. However, interviewing and segmenting users through personas helped resolve those contradictions. This was valuable for Authess as they developed their MVP and completed a round of funding.

                My team and I looked at dinner preparation because we were interested in ways that we could use technology to make everyday actions more sustainable. After calculating the impact of dinner preparation, we found that the embedded cost of ingredients was the greatest source of impact. With this in mind, we designed an app called "ReMixipe" that helps people “remix” their recipes.

              <h3>Cost to Produce, Use, and Dispose</h3>
              <p class="lead">
                To analyze the environmental impact of a stove, we ran a Life-Cycle Assessment on it. This meant looking at what a stovetop is made of and how much of each material. We then multiplied the total amount of each material by the environmental cost of that material(Ide-Mat 2012). To get the energy cost of cooking a meal, we measure the energy draw on the stove while using it.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                With these combined measurements, we had an estimation of the cost to produce, use, and dispose of the stove top. 
              </p>

            
              <p class="lead" >
                But then we ran a life-cycle assessment on an "average meal," which included meat, starch, and vegetables. We learned that the majority of impact of a meal comes from the food and not the stove.

              <img src="sustainable_design/grants_meal.jpg" alt="pie chart with images of food" class="photo_two" style = "width:80%">
              <p class = "lead">
                This suggested a new goal: rather than redesign a new stove, we should redesign how people decide what to cook.

                So, how do people decide what to cook? People we interviewed already have between 10 and 20 recipes that they cycle through. People cook what they cook because they know those recipes and feel comfortable with them.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                We envisioned an app that helps people cook more sustainable meals by modifying the recipes. This is a viable solution because <strong>it does not require a significant change in behavior, and it is in line with our personas' values.</strong> Grant likes to save money, and Patricia cares about the health of her children.

              <p class="lead">
                The app that we propose does more than substitute. It takes in recipes and creates a profile of the flavor compounds in the food. When ingredients are removed, new ingredients are substituted to achieve a similar alternative. Over time, the app will collect feedback from the user to develop an understanding of the user's preferences. Like a good DJ, it feels the crowd and plays to the taste of its audience.

A situation faced by Patricia is that she makes a meal for her family and the leftovers are not large enough for another meal. These awkwardly-sized portions are then left in the fridge to rot until disposed. To address this, the App solicits feedback from the user about the number of leftover servings so that it can scale recipes in the future.
