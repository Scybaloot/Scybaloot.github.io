	<h3>
		Intro
	</h3>
	<p>
		I took Human Factors in Interface Design in Fall of 2012 and learned about designing computer interfaces. In this class, my team and I designed a tablet app that helps people organize cooking events with their friends. We worked through several stages: persona creation, scenario mapping, raw ideation, design development, design refinement and finally a web implementation. We finished with a design that is optimized to remind users of upcoming events and trigger the creation of new events.  
	</p>
	<h3>
		Pain Points
	</h3>

	<p>
		Through interviews, we identified two pain points. 
		<ol>
		<li> 
			It is difficult for people to find times when both they and their friends are free. When organizing an event for many people, emails and texts become difficult to navigate. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Users find that agreeing on a recipe slows down the planning, and with several allergies or food restrictions in a group, the process is further complicated. 
		</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>
		Team:
	</h3>
	<p>
		Our team had five people on it: two electrical-computer engineering majors(ECE), a political science student, a computer science major, and me. Most of the work in this class centered on design, but there was a fair amount of programming involved, both in the development of the prototype and the website on which we documented our work. Coming into this course with no prior experience programming in HTML, CSS or Javascript, I had to pick them up quickly. Thanks to the support of the computer science major, I picked up all three languages, and I saw my role in the team expand from designer to programmer as my skillset increased.

	<h3>
		Persona Creation 
	</h3>
	<p>
		We started by learning about the values of this group, their familiarity with technology, the role that food plays in their life, and what they do for fun with friends. We placed portraits of the people we interviewed within several frameworks. When we placed users on a graph mapping frequency of cooking and amount of planning involved, we saw two clear groups emerge. These groups shaped our personas: Abby and Corinne.

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
	Corinne generally eats at the cafeteria and cooks once a month, planning what to cook the day of with her friends. </li> 
	<li> Abby cooks frequently with much planning. She cooks once a week, and plans out what to cook each week, picking up the groceries each Sunday. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>
	Comparables and inspiration
	<h3>
	<p>
	We were inspired by sites that allow people to collect feedback from others and find recipes to cook. The first example presents users with a mosaic of food pictures. This immediately draws people into thinking of food and engages users with the site. Clicking on an image, the user sees a recipe. This ease of movement from desire to planning helps people move beyond simply thinking about food to making it. To take this further, I could see a site going further and sending push notifications with a shopping list the next time the user is in a grocery store.  
	</p>

	<p>
	The second example is from Survey Monkey. We liked how survey monkey allows users to easily make surveys, collect feedback and share results with users. The flexibility of the kinds of feedback that can be collected is also a great feature. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The last two examples are from SuperCook. You can click on common ingredients listed to the left and a recipe with those ingredients emerges. Even by clicking on a few, you begin to see some recipes listed. You can also add unlisted ingredients by typing them in the box. If you have allergies or aversions, you can type in ingredients you would like to avoid. In the next page, you can see recipes that meet these criteria. For the recipes you cannot cook, missing ingredients are listed. This kind of tool simplifies the planning process, and would be especially appreciated by someone like Abby who doesn't plan ahead much, has limited storage space for ingredients, and a limited budget. 
	</P>
	<h3>
	Task Flow analysis
	</h3>
	<p>
	For each persona, we mapped out the process by which they decide on recipes then execute on the plans. Piecing these together, we had an overall-view of how different users go from thinking about food to cooking food. On the map to the right, each user is marked with dots on steps that they take.

	<h3>
	Initial ideation
	</h3>
	<p>
	My team started out with sketches of ideas on paper, using post-its for descriptions. Post-its are useful, because they allow team members to easily add and remove modifications to designs without changing the work of a team member. This encourages the sharing and remixing of ideas, which I find to be really valuable.  
	</p>
	<p>
	I wanted to include a feature that uses food to bring people together in a process that is easy and engaging. I imagined a photobook or way for users to look at pictures of food and select food that they want to cook. If two users who are friends express interest in the same food item, both of their calendars are searched for overlapping availability, and invitations are sent to both users, suggesting a time. However, most users that we talked to do not have their availability accurately documented in their calendars, so this design would not work for our users. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Another idea for the main page focused more on organization and presented the upcoming events so that users could easily check the app to stay up to date. For users that do not always have their calendar organized, this ended up being a particularly useful feature. This feature can be seen in Meetup, where users can track upcoming events, so I feel that this helps to validate our design.  
	</p>
	<h3>
	Redesigns
	</h3>
	<p>
	Throughout our design process, we ran usability studies and gained insights into what features of the app we needed to rework. Through peer evaluation, we gained insight into how to improve the timeline. The timeline is a tool on the homepage that allows users to see details of upcoming events. Our intent was that the user would simply click on each event on the timeline to see the details. However, this was not clear to users. Instead of redesigning the buttons, we realized that a change in orientation of the timeline from horizontal to vertical would create a simpler user interface. <br>
	For more detailed descriptions of changes and rationale, you can visit the team webpage. 
	</p>
	<h3>
	Future Work
	</h3>
	<p>
	Future work might look at addressing the difficulty in deciding on what to cook or bake. The app could do this if connected to users' calendars and Instagram or Pinterest accounts. If two users that are connected on the cooking app "heart" the same gram on Instagram or Pinterest, the app would know this and would search both calendars for overlapping availability. Another possibility is a Tinder-like swiping screen to identify what kinds of food each person likes, while also finding interest in specific recipes.
