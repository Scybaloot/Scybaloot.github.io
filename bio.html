		<h3>Bio</h3>

		<p>
			I am currently a UI/UX designer at Vecna Technologies where I define the functionality of products through research and iterative design. I graduated from Olin College, where I earned a BS in Engineering and saw the value of user-centered design.
		</p>
		<p>
			My design training has been mostly user-centered design, with an emphasis on usability and needs-identification. However, recently I have been studying information design and web development. In my free time, I also like to cook, paint, and play Go. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to learn more about my previous work or discuss design opportunities, feel free to message me on LinkedIn or email me at cdjsato@gmail.com.

			Thank you for your time, 
			<br>
			Colby
