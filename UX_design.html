				I took Human Factors in Interface Design in Fall of 2012 and learned about designing computer interfaces. In this class, my team and I designed a tablet app that helps people organize cooking events with their friends. We worked through several stages: persona creation, scenario mapping, raw ideation, design development, design refinement and finally a web implementation. We finished with a design that is optimized to remind users of upcoming events and trigger the creation of new events.

			My team and I looked a dinner preparation on a stovetop. We were interested in dinner preparation, because it is a key part of most peoples' day and is connected to things as individually meaningful as health and culture.

			After much research, we came to a surprising conclusion. We found that the embedded costs within the food itself had more of an impact than the stovetop or the energy to cook the food. With this knowledge in mind, we ended up designing an app called "ReMixipe" that helps people eat less meat without compromising flavor and reduce food waste.
