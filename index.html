            Intro
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            This past winter, I had some spare time, so I found myself looking for a design project. I started reading about collaboration technology, and I was thinking about ways that mobile platforms could be used to increase collaboration. One of my favorite collaboration tools is ShareLaTeX, so I spent some time thinking about that. Sharelatex is a collaborative, cloud-based, LaTeX editing tool that allows multiple users to simultaneously edit the same LaTeX document.

            Simplifying Functionality for Mobile
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            The first, simple approach was to simply take ShareLaTeX, break it into tabs or swipable screens, and move it onto a mobile app. However, I thought that an opportunity might be missed if we simply make the mobile app the same thing as the desktop version.

            Current Process
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Looking at the process of editing a research paper on ShareLaTeX or any platform, a pain point becomes clear: receiving edits takes time. Even if you want feedback on a tiny change, you need to send your entire paper over. Editing an entire paper requires a lot of time to be set aside, and that slows down the feedback process. 
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Even to have minor edits reviewed, a whole draft is generally sent.

          <p class="lead">
            This ShareLaTeX mobile app could decrease the time it takes to receive feedback, but it would certainly need to be tested and integrated in some way with the ShareLaTeX website. Another possible problem is how the sense of flow and awareness of the whole is lost when a piece of writing is segmented. However, if the writer and editor already have a shared understanding of the piece, possible errors could be mitigated. Future revisions of this app should seek to address that problem for users who are at the beginning of editing. Beyond editing LaTeX files, this process of cutting up writing pieces and sharing them for faster edits could be applied to other kinds of writing.

          <h3>
            Intro
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          My team and I looked at dinner preparation on a stovetop to think about ways that future technology could be used to make everyday actions more sustainable. We were interested in dinner preparation, because it is a key part of most peoples' day and is connected to things as personal and complex as health and culture. After much research, we came to a surprising conclusion. We found that the embedded costs within the food itself had more of an impact than the stovetop or the energy used to cook the food. With this knowledge in mind, we ended up designing an app called "ReMixipe" that helps people reduce food waste and eat less meat without compromising flavor. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Team
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          My team composed of three people: Aman Kapur, Anne-Marie Buchenan, and me. Aman was majoring in Engingeering with a Concentration in Computing, and Annie was majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I sourced the stove that we disassembled and handled the outreach for several interviews. Besides, that, we all shared similar design roles, participating in interviews, persona formation and idea generation. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Pain Points
        </h3>

        <p class="lead">
          We started this process by interviewing people, and developed two personas: Get 'Er Done Grant and Passionate Patricia, each with different expectations for their food. 

          <img src="sustainable_design/grant_patricia.png" alt="Pictures and descriptions of man and woman" class="photo_two" style = "width:90%">

          <ul>
          <li> 
            Grant values: cost, efficiency, convenience  
          </li>
          <li>
            Patricia values: quality, flavor, nutrition   
          </li>

        <h3>
          Comparing the Impact of Food and the Stovetop.
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          To look at the energy impact of cooking food, we measured the energy draw of a stovetop while food was cooked on it. We boiled a small pot of water, cooked a few steaks, cooked some potatoes and boiled some carrots. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          To analyze the environmental impact of a stove, we ran a Life-Cycle Assessment. We also purchased a used stovetop on Craigslist and then took it apart. We analyzed what each part was made of, weighed it, and looked up the environmental cost of that material per mass in the idemat database. With these combined measurements, we had an estimation of the cost to produce, and dispose of the stove top. 
        </p>
        <img src="sustainable_design/stovetop_diagram.png" alt="blow-up diagram of stovetop parts" class="photo_two" style = "width:70%">
        <p class="lead" >
          A part of dinner preparation is the food being prepared, so we included the impact of  a meal into our calculations. The situation we were looking at was a meal including chicken, veggies and potatoes cooked on a stove. The stove would probably be used for 13 to 20 years, and its impact was divided over the many uses in this timeframe. 
        </p>

        <img src="sustainable_design/grants_meal.png" alt="pie chart with images of food" class="photo_two" style = "width:80%;background-color:#FFFFFF;border-style:solid;border-width:5px">

        <p class="lead">
          What we found was that the vast majority of impact from a meal is the impact from the food cooked on the stove and not the stove itself. In other words, if you want to make cooking more sustainable, rather than designing a more energy-efficient stovetop, your time is better-spent redesigning the process by which people decide what to cook on the stovetop. This led us to look to the next stage: designing a mobile app that recommends modified recipes.

        <h3>
          Changing the Decision-Making Process 
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          So, how does one go about helping people make different food choices? Guilt-tripping might be the usual route for environmentalists, but we believe there's a better way. People we interviewed already have between 10 and 20 recipes that they cycle through. People cook what they cook because they know those recipes and feel comfortable with them.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          We envisioned an app that helps people cook more sustainable meals by modifying the recipes. This is a viable solution because it does not require a significant change in behavior, and it is in line with our personas' values. Grant likes to save money, and Patricia cares about the health of her children. A shopper can often save money and make healthier food by reducing the meat cooked and adding other options or leaner meat. For example, chicken is cheaper than beef, and it's more healthful. However, as the late Boromir might say: "one does not simply replace meat with tofu." And he's correct. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The app that we propose does more than substitute. It takes in recipes and creates a profile of the various flavor compounds in the food and how they balance each other out. When ingredients are substituted, new cooking methods and ingredients are suggested to achieve an appealing alternative. Over time, the app will collect feedback from the user to develop an understanding of the user's preferences. Like a good DJ, it feel the crowd and plays to the taste of its audience.

          How it Reduces Food Waste
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Ten percent of the US energy budget goes into food production, and as much as forty percent of food produced in the US is wasted. <a href = "http://www.nrdc.org/food/wasted-food.asp" style = "font-size: 24px">(National Resources Defense Council, 2012)</a> Part of the waste is food spoilage, but another aspect is food that has been prepared, but goes uneaten as leftovers. A situation faced by Patricia is that she makes a meal for her family and the leftovers are not large enough for another meal, but too large for another person's lunch. These awkwardly-sized portions are then left in the fridge to rot until disposed. This problem is solved in two ways by the app. The App scales the recipe to deliver the number of servings the user desires, and at the end of the meal the user can input the leftovers as an ingredient in a new recipe. For example, chicken breast can go into a pie, soup, or a casserole.

          Individual Work on App Design
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          The extent of the project was to look at an activity, and using user-centered design and environmental impact analysis tools, propose a solution. The solution was only developed to the point of a list of features and considerations based on the personas developed. Independently, I decided to take this work a step further and make some initial designs for the app. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Remixipe Task Flow Diagram
        </h3>

        <img src="sustainable_design/Remixipe_Flow_Diagram.png" alt="flow chart of actions" class="photo_two" style = "width: 90%">

        <p class="lead">
          Before designing the app, I analyzed the process envisioned using a flow diagram. I used sticky notes to write out decision points and steps, making several iterations on the diagram. After refinement in the mockups stage, I developed the diagram as it is above. While creating this diagram, I saw where major decision we made that would require a change in screen. This helped me to divide up actions ans see which actions should be grouped together on the same page. 
        </p>

        <h3>
          Mockups
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Following the rough draft of the task flow on sticky notes, I developed mockups on pieces of paper. After satisfied with the organization of steps, I translated these paper mockups into mockups in Balsamiq. This iteration allowed me to think more about the spacing of features and how to compress them into the iPhone screen. I organized the app into four main steps: Input, Remix, Cook and Review. 
        </p>

        <h3>
          Input
        </h3>

        <img src="sustainable_design/remixipe_steps.png" alt="flow chart of actions" class="photo_two" style = "width: 80%">

        <p class="lead">
          People store recipes and find them in a variety of ways, so the Input set of pages was designed to allow users to input recipes from a range of sources. For example, if the recipe stored on old recipe cards in Passionate Patricia's cabinet, then she can take a photo of the card, the app read the text. If Get 'er Done Grant is unsure of what he wants, but has an idea, he can search for recipes online.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Remix 
        </h3>

        <img src="sustainable_design/Remix.png" alt="flow chart of actions" class="photo_two" style = "width:80%">

        <p class="lead">
          People value different things in their meals, and the Remix page was designed to accommodate this. Users can choose between remixing their meal based on price, environmental impact, healthfulness and preparation time. Fortunately for the purposes of this app, three of the four metrics generally coincide with decreased environmental impact. For example, decreasing the cost of meals and increasing the nutritional value of them can be accomplished by reducing meat consumption while increasing the number of vegetables. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          More themes on which to remix foods were considered, but based on Grant's desire for simplicity and affordability and Patricia's emphasis on nutritional value, these themes should be sufficient. 
        </p>

        <h3>
          Cook
        </h3>

        <img src="sustainable_design/Cook.png" alt="flow chart of actions" class="photo_two" style = "width:80%">

        <p class="lead">
          The Cook Page allows users both do three things: Cook the recipe, save the recipe for later, and reject the current recipe to try a different remix theme. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Passionate patricia has difficulty with technology, so I wanted to avoid the possibility of misclicks and reduce the amount of navigation. To do this, steps and ingredients were included on the same page. An added benefit of this is that with all of them on the same page, the user can easily see the relationship between them. 
        </p>

        <h3>
          Review
        </h3>

        <img src="sustainable_design/Review.png" alt="flow chart of actions" class="photo_two" style = "width:80%">

        <p class="lead">
          The review page allows users to give feedback on the flavor balance of the meal and rate the meal. If there are leftovers, the user can use them to make a new remix. The feedback on the flavor balance and overall rating are optional, but I made the number of leftovers not optional. From interviews, we found that much of the food waste post-purchase happens when someone makes too much food and then those leftovers go uneaten. If the app could properly scale recipes to reduce the amount of unwanted leftovers, then our users can reduce their food waste without any extra work. 
        </p>

        <h3>
          Future Work
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
        These are mockups and are useful for initial idea exploration, but with any iteration, they could be improved. Questions remain surrounding whether Passionate Patricia and Get 'Er Done Grant would actually use the app. If they do not, what are reasons they choose not to? I tried to reduce the number of steps in the app, but there are probably ways to simplify further. There's also the challenge of user adoption. Passionate Patricia usually cooks from memory, so this app needs to make a compelling enough reason to become part of her routine. We might be able to take cues from other apps that people have incorporated into their lives.  Perhaps adoption will be easier with Grant. Grant just wants to cook something, and inputting a recipe then remixing it adds additional steps. Grant finds the majority of his recipes online, so perhaps for Grant the ReMixipe app makes more sense as a web browser plugin. Perhaps, we might take a cue from the Internet of things movement and incorporate the app into the stovetop itself? These questions and more would need to be investigated in codesign sessions with the users. Regardless of the best solution, the insights gained through this process will surely be of value.

Insert continuation of project. 

In June, I was notified of an education hackathon in Boston. This hackathon was run by Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt, a K-12 education company. I realized that a sharelatex plugin would not be the best fit for this hackathon, so I thought to modify it to make it about editing a paper. 

I was joined by three other people. Nathan Goodman, a CS major from Northeastern, Jesse Oberstein also from Northeastern, and Giri, a senior software engineer in the area.

          <h3>
            Intro
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
          In 2012, I took a class in Human Interface Design, and began to appreciate the thought and process that goes into designing computer interfaces. In this class, my team and I designed a tablet app that helps people organize cooking events with their friends. We worked through several stages: persona creation, scenario mapping, raw ideation, design development, design refinement and finally an interactive prototype. We finished with a design that is optimized to remind users of upcoming events and inspire the creation of new events.  </p>
          <h3>
            Pain Points
          </h3>

          <p class = "lead">
            Through interviews, we identified two pain points. 
            <ol class = "lead">
            <li> 
              It is difficult for people to find times when both they and their friends are free. When organizing an event for many people, emails and texts become difficult to navigate. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Users find that agreeing on a recipe slows down the planning, and with several allergies or food restrictions in a group, the process is further complicated. 
            </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h3>
            Team:
          </h3>
          <p class = "lead">
            Our team had five people in it: two electrical-computer engineering majors(ECE), a political science student, a computer science major, and me. As a UI design course, there was a fair amount of programming involved. Coming into this course with no prior experience programming in HTML, CSS, or Javascript, I had to pick them up quickly. With the support of the computer science student, I was able to pick up programming. By the end of the project, not only did was I contributing to the design of the app--I was also pushing code.

          <h3>
            Persona Creation 
          </h3>
          <p class = "lead">
            We started by learning about the values of this group, their familiarity with technology, the role that food plays in their life, and what they do for fun with friends. We placed portraits of the people we interviewed within several frameworks. When we placed users on axis for frequency of cooking and the amount of planning involved, we saw two clear groups emerge. These groups shaped our personas: Abby and Corinne. 
          </p>

            
            <img src="HFID_images/Process_Corinne_Persona.JPG" alt="Corinne Persona" class="photo_two" style = "width:80%">
    
          <p class = "lead">
          Corinne generally eats at the cafeteria and cooks once a month, planning what to cook the day of with her friends.
          </p>
          <img src = "HFID_images/Process_Abby_Persona.JPG" alt="Abby Persona" class="photo_two" style = "width:80%">
          <p class="lead">
          Abby cooks frequently with much planning. She cooks once a week, and plans out what to cook each week, picking up the groceries each Sunday. 
          </p>

          <h3>
          Comparables and inspiration
          </h3>

          <img src = "HFID_images/inspirational_designs_02.png" alt="Recipes Pictures" class="photo center">
          
          
          <p class = "lead">
          We were inspired by sites that allow people to collect feedback from others and find recipes to cook. The first example presents users with a mosaic of food pictures. This immediately draws people into thinking of food and engages users with the site. Clicking on an image, the user sees a recipe. This ease of movement from desire to planning helps people move beyond simply thinking about food to making it. To take this further, I could see a site sending push notifications with a shopping list the next time the user is in a grocery store.  
          </p>

          <img src="HFID_images/inspirational_designs_06.png" alt="Corinne Persona" class="photo center" style = "width:80%">
          
          <p class = "lead">
          The second example is from Survey Monkey. We liked how survey monkey allows users to easily make surveys, collect feedback and share results with users. The flexibility of the kinds of feedback that can be collected is also a great feature. 
          </p>
          <p class = "lead">
          The last two examples are from SuperCook. You can click on common ingredients listed to the left and a recipe with those ingredients emerges. Even by clicking on a few, you begin to see some recipes listed. You can also add unlisted ingredients by typing them in the box. If you have allergies or aversions, you can type in ingredients you would like to avoid. In the next page, you can see recipes that meet these criteria. For the recipes you cannot cook, missing ingredients are listed. This kind of tool simplifies the planning process, and would be especially appreciated by someone like Abby who doesn't plan ahead, has limited storage space for ingredients, and has a limited budget. 
          </P>
          <h3>
          Task Flow analysis
          </h3>
          <p class = "lead">
          For each persona, we mapped out the process by which they decide on recipes then make the food. Piecing these together, we had an overview of how different users go from thinking about food to cooking food. On the map below, each user is marked with dots on steps that they take. 
          </p>
          
          <img src = "HFID_images/Flow_Planning_to_Food.JPG" alt="Task Flow Analysis" class="photo center" style = "width:80%">

          <h3>
          Initial ideation
          </h3>
          <p class = "lead">
          My team started out with sketches of ideas on paper, using post-its for descriptions. Post-its are useful, because they allow team members to easily add and remove modifications to designs without changing the work of a team member. This encourages the sharing and remixing of ideas, which I find to be really valuable.  
          </p>
          <p class = "lead">
          I wanted to include a feature that uses food to bring people together in a process that is easy and engaging. I imagined a photobook or way for users to look at pictures of food and select food that they want to cook. If two users who are friends express interest in the same food item, both of their calendars are searched for overlapping availability, and invitations are sent to both users, suggesting a time. However, most users that we talked to do not have their availability accurately documented in their calendars, so this design would not work for our users. 
          </p>

          <p class = "lead">
          Another idea for the main page focused more on organization. This main page and presents the upcoming events so that users can easily check the app to stay up to date. For users that do not always have their calendar organized, this ended up being a particularly useful feature. This feature can be seen in Meetup, where users can track upcoming events.   
          </p>
          <h3>
          Redesigns
          </h3>
          <p class = "lead">
          Throughout our design process, we ran usability studies and gained insights into what features of the app we needed to rework. Through peer evaluation, we gained insight into how to improve the timeline. The timeline is a tool on the homepage that allows users to see details of upcoming events. Our intent was that the user would simply click on each event on the timeline to see the details. However, this was not clear to users. Instead of redesigning the buttons, we realized that a change in orientation of the timeline from horizontal to vertical would create a simpler user interface. <br>
          For more detailed descriptions of changes and rationale, you can visit the team webpage. 
          </p>
          <h3>
          Future Work
          </h3>
          <p class = "lead">
          Future work might look at addressing the difficulty in deciding what to cook or bake. The app could do this if connected to users' calendars and Instagram or Pinterest accounts. If two users that are connected on the cooking app "heart" the same post on Instagram or Pinterest, the app would know this and would search both calendars for overlapping availability. Another possibility is a Tinder-like swiping screen to identify what kinds of food each person likes and using this to create suggestions for users. Many ideas are possible, but the appropriateness of features would depend on what users are the main audience. 
          </p>
