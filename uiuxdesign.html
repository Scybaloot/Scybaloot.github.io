            About the Project
          </h2>
          <p class="lead"> 
            My first exposure to designing user interfaces happened in college when my team and I designed a tablet app that helps people organize cooking events.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Pain Points
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Through interviews, we identified two main pain points. 
          </p>
          <ol class = "lead emphasis">
            <li> 
              People struggle to find time when everyone is available
            </li>
            <li>
              Emails and texts do not summarize the key details, so it’s easy to lose track of them.           
            </li>
          </ol>

            In addition to contributing to research and synthesis, I helped program the prototype in HTML/CSS.

            About the Project
          </h2>
          <p class="lead">
            One of my favorite collaboration tools is GoogleDocs, but it's limited to use on a desktop. In this project, I explored how a mobile version of GoogleDocs could improve the overall user experience. In the end, I arrived at some wireframes for a Google Docs Mobile App that focuses on "chunking" text into easily-editable chunks.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What is Google Docs?
          </h3>
          </a>
          <p class = "lead">
            Google Docs is a cloud-based word-processing tool that allows many people to simultaneously contribute to the same document. This is great for teams that are working together to create a piece of writing.  
          </p>
        
          <h3>
            Simplifying Functionality for Mobile
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Google docs already has a mobile version, but it has some problems: Navigation, focus of action, and overall ease-of-use.  
          </p>
          <h3>
            Receiving Feedback is a Slow Process
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Looking at the process of editing a word document on Google Docs, a pain point becomes clear: receiving edits takes time. This is because even if a writer wants feedback on a tiny change, the writer needs to send their entire draft over. Editing an entire draft requires setting aside a large chunk of time. Large chunks of time are difficult to find in a busy schedule, so this impedes the feedback process.

          <p class="lead">
            What if instead, a writer could send edits over in pieces that could easily fit into the editor’s busy schedule? This would be valuable for questions related to the clarity of sentences and paragraphs.

            The mobile platform allows for editing all the time. The advisor/editor can edit on the train or while waiting for a pot to boil. Time that would normally be idle can now be used more productively.

            The process would start after the user edits a piece of a paper. The user selects it to be shared as a "chunk." This "chunk" then shows up on the mobile app for reviewers to see. All changes and comments are tracked, showing up in the desktop version. 
          </p>
      
          <p class = "lead">
            The opening page is where all "chunks" can be accessed. When a chunk is selected it can be edited.

            Users value efficiency, productivity, and learning. This app offers would appeal to users through these values by helping them incorporate feedback more regularly. If users can do this, they can apply their learning and produce better writing in less time.

            The main criticism I have heard is that users might lose a sense of context when making edits. To remedy that, it may be helpful to build into each chunk a way to read the context of the piece around it or have specific requests for feedback from the writer. 
          </p>
          <p class = "lead">
            However, to keep future work focused it's important to remember that the goal of this app is not to supplant the desktop version, but supplement it. It's for those times between first and final drafts where you need quick, easy feedback. Beyond editing LaTeX files, this breaking up of work could probably be applied to other kinds of writing as well.

          Out of the Classroom
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          This app came out of work done in a sustainable design course. The main finding of our research was that the majority of impact in a meal comes from the food. Knowing this, the target of our redesign became the process by which people decide what to cook. To achieve this, we came up with the idea for a mobile app that allows users to "remix" their recipes.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          After the class ended, I decided to take our initial findings a step further by making them into mockups. To see the prior research, click <a href="userresearch.html#sustainable_cooking" target="sustainable design research">here</a>.

          <p class = "lead">
            Before designing the app, I analyzed the process envisioned using a flow diagram. I used sticky notes to write out decision points and steps, making several iterations on the diagram. While creating this diagram, I saw where major decision were made that would require a change in screen. This helped me to divide up actions and see which actions should be grouped together on the same page.

            Mockups
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Following the rough draft of the task flow, I sketched mockups on paper. Satisfied that all suer goals could be completed, I translated these paper mockups into mockups in Balsamiq. Working in Balsamiq then helped me to think more about the spacing of features and how to arrange them in the iPhone screen. In the end, I organized the app into four main steps: Input, Remix, Cook and Review.

            <p class="lead">
              People store and find recipes in a variety of ways, so the Input pages were designed to allow users to input recipes from these different sources. For example, if Passionate Patricia uses recipe cards, she can take a photo of the card and the app reads the text. If Get 'er Done Grant is unsure of what he wants but has an idea, he can search for recipes online.

          These mockups are useful for initial idea exploration, and I believe all main functionalities have been captured. The next step would be to put them in front of users for feedback.

          More specifically, I'd like to see users operate it one-handed while walking around a busy grocery store after work. How would the urgency of hunger, the exhaustion from work, and the chaos of other shoppers change the experience? This test may sound oddly specific, but I've found realistic tests reveal challenges and areas of opportunity that other tests do not.
