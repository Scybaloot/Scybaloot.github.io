            Intro
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            In 2012 I took a class in Human-Computer Interaction and learned methods for iteratively developing computer applications. In this class, my team and I designed a tablet app that helps people organize cooking events with their friends. We worked through several stages: persona creation, scenario mapping, raw ideation, design development, and finally a click-through prototype.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Pain Points
          </h3>

          <p class = "lead">
            Through interviews, we identified two pain points. 
            <ol class = "lead">
            <li> 
              It is difficult for people to find times when both they and their friends are free.
            </li>
            <li>
               When organizing an event for many people, planning by emails and texts become difficult to manage. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Users find that agreeing on a recipe slows down the planning, and with several allergies or food restrictions in a group, the process is further complicated. 
            </li>
            </ol>

          <p class = "lead">
            Our team had five people in it: two electrical-computer engineering majors(ECE), a political science student, a computer science major, and me. My role was a mix of user research, testing, wireframing, and coding.

            Persona Creation

          <p class = "lead">
            We started by learning about the values of this group, their familiarity with technology, the role of food in their life, and what they do for fun with friends. We placed portraits of the people we interviewed within several frameworks. Through this activity, we saw two groups emerge that were then captured in our personas: Abby and Corinne.

            Below is such an example. The timeline is a tool on the homepage that allows users to see details of upcoming events. Our intent was that the user would simply click on each event to see the details. However, this was not clear to users. Instead of redesigning the buttons, we realized that a change in orientation of the timeline from horizontal to vertical would allow us to display the details up-front.

          <p class="lead">
            One of my favorite collaboration tools is ShareLaTeX, but it's limited to use on a desktop. In this project, I explored what functionality might translate well to mobile, and how that would affect workflows. In the end, I arrived at some wireframes for a ShareLaTeX Mobile App.

            </h3>
          </a>
          <p class = "lead">
            Sharelatex is a collaborative, cloud-based, LaTeX editing tool that allows multiple users to simultaneously edit the same LaTeX document. LaTeX is often used by people in academia to write research papers by combining figures, captions, and paragraphs of text. 
          </p>

            Simplifying Functionality for Mobile
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            The first, simple approach was to simply take ShareLaTeX, break it into tabs or swipable screens, and move it onto a mobile app. However, in initial mock-ups, I realized that editing precise syntax would be cumbersome and not the best use of mobile. I then shifted the question to be: "What might people use a ShareLaTeX app for that they wouldn't use the desktop version for?"

          <h3>
            Receiving Feedback is a Slow Process
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Looking at the process of editing a research paper on ShareLaTeX or any platform, a pain point becomes clear: receiving edits takes time. This is because even if a writer wants feedback on a tiny change, the writer needs to send their entire draft over. Editing an entire draft requires setting aside a large chunk of time. Large chunks of time are difficult to find in a busy schedule, so this impedes the feedback process.

            What if instead, a writer could send edits over in pieces that could easily fit into the editor’s busy schedule? This would be valuable for questions related to the clarity of sentences and paragraphs.

            The process would start after the user edits a piece of a paper. The user selects it to be shared as a "chunk." This "chunk" then shows up on the mobile app for reviewers to see. All changes and comments are tracked, showing up in the desktop version.

          <p class="lead">
            The main criticism I have heard is that users might lose a sense of context when making edits. To remedy that, it may be helpful to build into each chunk a way to read the context of the piece around it or have specific requests for feedback from the writer. 
          </p>
          <p class = "lead">
            However, to keep future work focused it's important to remember that the goal of this app is not to supplant the desktop version, but supplement it. It's for those times between first and final drafts where you need quick, easy feedback. Beyond editing LaTeX files, this breaking up of work could probably be applied to other kinds of writing as well.

          Out of the Classroom
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          This app came out of work done in a sustainable design course. The main finding of our research was that the majority of impact in a meal comes from the food. Knowing this, the target of our redesign became the process by which people decide what to cook. To achieve this, we came up with the idea for a mobile app that allows users to "remix" their recipes.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          After the class ended, I decided to take our initial findings a step further by making them into mockups. To see the prior research, click <a href="userresearch.html#sustainable_cooking" target="sustainable design research">here</a>. 
        </p>

        <div class = "col-md-2"></div>
        <div class = "col-md-8">
          <p class = "lead">
            Before designing the app, I analyzed the process envisioned using a flow diagram. I used sticky notes to write out decision points and steps, making several iterations on the diagram. While creating this diagram, I saw where major decision were made that would require a change in screen. This helped me to divide up actions and see which actions should be grouped together on the same page.

          <h3>
            Mockups
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Following the rough draft of the task flow, I sketched mockups on paper. Satisfied that all suer goals could be completed, I translated these paper mockups into mockups in Balsamiq. Working in Balsamiq then helped me to think more about the spacing of features and how to arrange them in the iPhone screen. In the end, I organized the app into four main steps: Input, Remix, Cook and Review.

              Input
            </h3>
            <p class="lead">
              People store and find recipes in a variety of ways, so the Input pages were designed to allow users to input recipes from these different sources. For example, if Passionate Patricia uses recipe cards, she can take a photo of the card and the app reads the text. If Get 'er Done Grant is unsure of what he wants but has an idea, he can search for recipes online.

          More specifically, I'd like to see users operate it one-handed while walking around a busy grocery store after work. How would the urgency of hunger, the exhaustion from work, and the chaos of other shoppers change the experience? This test may sound oddly specific, but I've found realistic tests reveal challenges and areas of opportunity that other tests do not.
