				I took Human Factors in Interface Design and learned about designing computer interfaces. My team and I designed a tablet app that helps people organize cooking events with their friends. We started with user research, and ended with a prototype. The goals of the final design are to remind users of their events and inspire the creation of new ones.

			My team and I looked a dinner preparation on a stovetop. We were interested in dinner preparation, because it is a key part of most peoples' day and is connected to things as individually meaningful as health and culture.

			After much research, we came to a surprising conclusion. We found that the embedded costs within the food itself had more of an impact than the stovetop or the energy to cook the food. With this knowledge in mind, we ended up designing an app called "ReMixipe" that helps people eat less meat without compromising flavor and reduce food waste.
