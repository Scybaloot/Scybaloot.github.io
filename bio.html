		<h3>Bio</h3>

		<p>
			I am currently a UI/UX designer at Vecna Technologies where I define the features of products and the feasibility of different solutions. I graduated from Olin College of Engineering, where I earned a BS in Engineering and developed a deep appreciation for the design process.
		</p>
		<p>
			My design training has been mostly user-centered design, with an emphasis on usability and needs-identification. However, recently I have been studying information design and collaboration technology. As is evident in my portfolio, I am obsessed with food. It tastes good, I love to cook, and it has deep ties to culture and sustainability. I also like to paint and play Go. 
		</p>

			If you want to learn more about my previous work or discuss design, feel free to message me on LinkedIn or email me at cdjsato@gmail.com. This current site is under construction, so please see my portfolio site for more samples of my work.

			Best,
