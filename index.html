            In the spring of 2015 I conducted user research for Authess, an early-stage education technology startup. The focus of this research was understanding students' experiences with online education assessment tools. At the end of the project I produced personas and recommendations for ways to address the needs and pain points of their users.

            As seen in the user portraits, most users have a combination of both kinds of groups. Reading deeper into the summaries, I saw themes of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. This difference in motivation affected their attitude toward their class, how they study for it, and how they perform. Though simplistic from a pedagogical perspective, this was a good place to start asking more questions.

                </li>
                <li>
                  The flexible schedule of online courses allows Grant to procrastinate, leading to a buildup of work at the end of the semester.

                <li>
                  Grant is frustrated when other students cheat. When students take tests outside of the classroom and answers are multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank, it is easy for students to cheat.

                  <li>
                    Curry learns better when she engages in conversations with other students, and that can be lacking in online courses that don't have forums or collaboration built in.

            <p class="lead">
              Answers in Authess are based on problem-solving approaches, so Grant can still get credit for what steps he followed correctly. Because questions are not limited to multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank, tests are more difficult to cheat on. Combined, Authess address two of Grant’s three pain points associated with online education assessment. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Authess' questions are based on ways of thinking and concepts, so Authess’ approach to assessment aligns with Curry’s learning goals. By explaining how the answers relate to concepts, Authess can help Curry to understand more deeply. Curry also seeks interaction with other students. Though forums are not a core feature of Authess, they certainly could be in the future. If Authess wanted to scale in the future, Authess could possibly even rely on users such as Curious Curry to create their own tests using Authess’ platform.
            </p>

            <h3> Result </h3>
            <p class="lead">
              Before the research, it seemed that the users contradicted each other, but this segmentation helped resolve those contradictions. This was valuable for Authess as they developed their MVP and completed a round of funding.

            Intro
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            This past winter I had some spare time, so I found myself looking for a design project. I started reading about collaboration technology, and I often saw mobile mentioned as part of the product offering. One of my favorite collaboration tools is ShareLaTeX, so I looked into ways a mobile platform could supplement ShareLaTeX.

            </h3>
          </a>
          <p class = "lead">
            Sharelatex is a collaborative, cloud-based, LaTeX editing tool that allows multiple users to simultaneously edit the same LaTeX document. In the end, I arrived at some wireframes for a ShareLaTeX Mobile App.

            Simplifying Functionality for Mobile
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            The first, simple approach was to simply take ShareLaTeX, break it into tabs or swipable screens, and move it onto a mobile app. However, I thought that an opportunity might be missed if we settle with making the functionality the same. I decided to start with the question: "How do people currently use ShareLaTeX?" and "What might people use it for that they wouldn't use the desktop version for?"

            Looking at the process of editing a research paper on ShareLaTeX or any platform, a pain point becomes clear: receiving edits takes time because people. Even if you want feedback on a tiny change, you need to send your entire paper over. Editing an entire paper requires a lot of time to be set aside, and that slows down the feedback process.

            The main criticism I have heard is that users might lose a sense of context when making edits. To remedy that, it may be helpful to build into each snippet a way to read the context of the piece around it or have specific requests for feedback from the writer. 
          </p>
          <p class = "lead">
            However, to keep future work focused it's important to remember that the goal of this app is not to supplant the desktop version, but supplement it. It's for those times between first and final drafts where you need quick, easy feedback. Beyond editing LaTeX files, this breaking up of work could probably be applied to other kinds of writing as well.

        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          My team and I looked at dinner preparation to explore ways that technology could be leveraged to make everyday actions more sustainable. After calculating the impact of dinner preparation, we found that the embedded cost of the food was more significant than the energy used to cook it. With this knowledge in mind, we designed an app called "ReMixipe" that helps people “remix” their recipes to reduce impact.

          <h3>Cost to Use</h3>

            To look at the energy impact of cooking food, we measured the energy draw of a stovetop while food was cooked on it. 
          </p>
          <h3>Cost to Produce and Dispose</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            To analyze the environmental impact of a stove, we ran a Life-Cycle Assessment on it. This meant basically looking at what a stovetop is made of and how much of each material. We then multiplied the total amount of each material by the environmental cost of that material(Ide-Mat 2012). 
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            With these combined measurements, we had an estimation of the cost to produce, use, and dispose of the stove top.

        <h3>
          Changing the Decision-Making Process 
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          So, how does one go about helping people make different food choices? Guilt-tripping might be the usual route for environmentalists, but we believe there's a better way. People we interviewed already have between 10 and 20 recipes that they cycle through. People cook what they cook because they know those recipes and feel comfortable with them.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          We envisioned an app that helps people cook more sustainable meals by modifying the recipes. This is a viable solution because it does not require a significant change in behavior, and it is in line with our personas' values. Grant likes to save money, and Patricia cares about the health of her children. A shopper can often save money and make healthier food by reducing the meat cooked or using different meats. For example, tofu is cheaper than beef, and it's more healthful. However, as the late Boromir might say: "one does not simply replace meat with tofu." And he's correct. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The app that we propose does more than substitute. It takes in recipes and creates a profile of the various flavor compounds in the food and how they work together. When ingredients are substituted, new cooking methods and ingredients are suggested to achieve an appealing alternative. Over time, the app will collect feedback from the user to develop an understanding of the user's preferences. Like a good DJ, it feels the crowd and plays to the taste of its audience.

          How it Reduces Waste
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Ten percent of the US energy budget goes into food production, and as much as forty percent of food produced in the US is wasted. <a href = "http://www.nrdc.org/food/wasted-food.asp" style = "font-size: 24px">(National Resources Defense Council, 2012)</a> Part of the waste is food spoilage, but another aspect is food that has been prepared goes uneaten as leftovers. A situation faced by Patricia is that she makes a meal for her family and the leftovers are not large enough for another meal. These awkwardly-sized portions are then left in the fridge to rot until disposed. To address this, the App solicits feedback from the user about the number of leftover servings so that it can scale recipes in the future.

          The extent of the research project was to look at an activity and propose a solution. The solution was only developed to the point of a list of features and general requirements. Independently, I took this work a step further and made some initial designs for the app.

        <p class = "lead">
          Before designing the app, I analyzed the process envisioned using a flow diagram. I used sticky notes to write out decision points and steps, making several iterations on the diagram. While creating this diagram, I saw where major decision were made that would require a change in screen. This helped me to divide up actions and see which actions should be grouped together on the same page.

          Mockups

        <p class="lead">
          Following the rough draft of the task flow, I sketched mockups on paper. Satisfied that all suer goals could be completed, I translated these paper mockups into mockups in Balsamiq. Working in Balsamiq then helped me to think more about the spacing of features and how to arrange them in the iPhone screen. In the end, I organized the app into four main steps: Input, Remix, Cook and Review.

          People store and find recipes in a variety of ways, so the Input pages were designed to allow users to input recipes from these different sources. For example, if Passionate Patricia uses recipe cards, she can take a photo of the card and the app reads the text. If Get 'er Done Grant is unsure of what he wants but has an idea, he can search for recipes online.

How would the urgency of hunger, the exhaustion from work, and the chaos of other shoppers change the experience? This may sound oddly specific, but I've often found insights from realistic tests help to take products to the next level.

Insert continuation of project. 

In June, I was notified of an education hackathon in Boston. This hackathon was run by Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt, a K-12 education company. I realized that a sharelatex plugin would not be the best fit for this hackathon, so I thought to modify it to make it about editing a paper. 

I was joined by three other people. Nathan Goodman, a CS major from Northeastern, Jesse Oberstein also from Northeastern, and Giri, a senior software engineer in the area.

Here are some examples of our user scenarios.

            The homepage is divided into action on the left and organization on the right. On the left of the homepage are buttons for creating events and matching with other users. On the right is the timeline and buttons to access the recipe countertop and friends list. After settling on this design, we moved to computer mockups.

            Redesigns
          </h2>
          <p class = "lead">
            Throughout our design process, we ran usability studies. After each round of codesigns, we would incorporate insights gained into the next iteration. 
          </p>
          <p class = "lead">
            Below is such an example. The timeline is a tool on the homepage that allows users to see details of upcoming events. Our intent was that the user would simply click on each event to see the details. However, this was not clear to users. Instead of redesigning the buttons, we realized that a change in orientation of the timeline from horizontal to vertical would allow us to display the details up-front.

          Since learning sketch, I've been returning to old projects to look at what a higher-fidelity mockup would look like. I've taken the home page from this project and cleaned it up. The "Create Event" button is green to emphasize that action. To improve legibility of the text, I made it white and tinted the food image.
