        <h3>
          Individual Work on App Design
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          The extent of the research project was to look at an activity and propose a solution. The solution was only developed to the point of a list of features and general requirements. Independently, I took this work a step further and made some initial designs for the app. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
      
        <img src="sustainable_design/Remixipe_Flow_Diagram.jpg" alt="flow chart of actions" class="photo_two" style = "width: 100%">

        <div class = "col-md-8">
        <p class = "lead">
          Before designing the app, I analyzed the process envisioned using a flow diagram. I used sticky notes to write out decision points and steps, making several iterations on the diagram. While creating this diagram, I saw where major decision were made that would require a change in screen. This helped me to divide up actions and see which actions should be grouped together on the same page. 
        </p>

        <h3>
          Mockups
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Following the rough draft of the task flow, I sketched mockups on paper. Satisfied that all suer goals could be completed, I translated these paper mockups into mockups in Balsamiq. Working in Balsamiq then helped me to think more about the spacing of features and how to arrange them in the iPhone screen. In the end, I organized the app into four main steps: Input, Remix, Cook and Review.

           <h3>
            Input
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            People store and find recipes in a variety of ways, so the Input pages were designed to allow users to input recipes from these different sources. For example, if Passionate Patricia uses recipe cards, she can take a photo of the card and the app reads the text. If Get 'er Done Grant is unsure of what he wants but has an idea, he can search for recipes online.

              People value different things in their meals, and the Remix page was designed to accommodate the values shared by Grant and Patricia. Users can choose between remixing their meal based on price, environmental impact, healthfulness, or preparation time.

          Future Work
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
        These mockups are useful for initial idea exploration, and I believe all main functionalities have been captured. The next step would be to put them in front of users for feedback. More specifically, I'd like to see users operate it one-handed while walking around a busy grocery store after work. How would the urgency of hunger, the exhaustion from work, and the chaos of other shoppers change the experience? This may sound oddly specific, but I've often found insights from realistic tests help to take products to the next level.

<!-- 
Insert continuation of project. 

In June, I was notified of an education hackathon in Boston. This hackathon was run by Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt, a K-12 education company. I realized that a sharelatex plugin would not be the best fit for this hackathon, so I thought to modify it to make it about editing a paper. 

I was joined by three other people. Nathan Goodman, a CS major from Northeastern, Jesse Oberstein also from Northeastern, and Giri, a senior software engineer in the area.
