            About the Project
          </h2>
          <p class="lead"> 
            My first exposure to designing user interfaces happened in college when my team and I designed a tablet app that helps people organize cooking events.
          </p>

            Pain Points
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Through interviews, we identified two main pain points. 
          </p>
          <ol class = "lead emphasis">
            <li> 
              People struggle to find time when everyone is available
            </li>
            <li>
              Emails and texts do not summarize the key details, so it’s easy to lose track of them.           
            </li>

            About the Project
          </h2>
          <p class="lead">
            One of my favorite collaboration tools is GoogleDocs, but it's limited to use on a desktop. In this project, I explored how a mobile version of GoogleDocs could improve the overall user experience. In the end, I arrived at some wireframes for a Google Docs Mobile App that focuses on "chunking" text into easily-editable chunks.
          </p>

            What is Google Docs?
          </h3>
          </a>
          <p class = "lead">
            Google Docs is a web-based word-processing tool that allows many people to simultaneously contribute to the same document. This is great for teams that are writing together.  
          </p>
        
          <h3>
            Simplifying Functionality for Mobile
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Google docs already has a mobile version, but it has some problems: navigation, focus of action, and overall ease-of-use.  
          </p>
          <h3>
            Receiving Feedback is a Slow Process
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Looking at the process of editing a word document on Google Docs, a pain point becomes clear: receiving edits takes time. This is because even if a writer wants feedback on a tiny change, the writer needs to send their entire draft over. Editing an entire draft requires setting aside a large chunk of time, and large chunks of time are difficult to find in a busy schedule. 
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            What if instead, a writer could send edits over in chunks that could easily fit into the editor’s busy schedule? This would be valuable for edits around sentence flow, grammar, and sentence clarity.

            The mobile platform allows for editing all the time. The advisor/editor can edit on the train or while waiting for a pot to boil. Time that would normally be idle can now be used more productively.

            The process would start after the writer edits a piece of writing. The writer selects it to be shared as a "chunk." This "chunk" then shows up on the mobile app for reviewers to see. All changes and comments are tracked, and show up in the desktop version of Google docs.
          </p>
      
          <p class = "lead">
            The opening page is where all "chunks" can be accessed. When a chunk is selected it can be edited.

          <p class="lead">
            The main criticism I have heard is that users might lose a sense of context when making edits. However, to keep future product development focused, it's important to remember that the goal of this app is not to replace the desktop version, but support it. It's for those times between first and final drafts when you need quick, and regular feedback.

          Out of the Classroom
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          In a sustainable design course, my team and I found that <a href="userresearch.html#sustainable_cooking" target="sustainable design research">the majority of impact in a meal comes from the food, not the energy used to cook it.</a> With the goal of changing what people cook, my team came up with the idea of an app that substitutes ingredients in recipes to make them more sustainable. After the class ended, I turned the basic concepts into a vision prototype that could be tested.

          Remixipe Task-Flow Analysis

        <p class = "lead">
          Before designing the app, I analyzed the process using a flow diagram. By creating this diagram, I saw how different actions connected in the overall user journey. This helped me to organize the UI.

            Following the task flow, I sketched mockups on paper and Balsamiq. Working at such low fidelity helped me explore ideas and cover all user actions. In this current iteration, I organized the app into four main steps: Input, Remix, Cook and Review.

        <p class="lead">
          Now that I have mockups that capture the basic activities, the next step is to test with users.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          More specifically, I'd like to test whether or not people are interested in trying "remixed" recipes. We could start by "remixing" common recipes and see if people actually cook with the new recipes. After that, we could "remix" recipes that are user-submitted and gradually increase how much we simulate the experience of the app. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          After this basic validation, then we can move onto usability of the app.
