          About the Project
        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          One of my favorite collaboration tools is Google Docs. I tried to use the Google Docs mobile app, but found it difficult to navigate larger documents. In this project, I explored a mobile app for editing and commenting on Google Docs. In the end, I arrived at some wireframes for a Mobile App that focuses on "chunking" text into easily-editable chunks. I brought this idea to an education technology hackathon, and my team ended up <a href="http://blog.bemyapp.com/curious-codefest-hmh-edtech-hackathon-winners/" target="HMH Win"> winning second place.</a>

          Usability Challenges on Mobile
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Use-Case on Mobile
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Google docs are generally consumed on desktop, but there are times when one needs to make edits on mobile. This could be while commuting to work on the train, and a request for feedback comes in from a coworker. This kind of work is focused generally on content changes. Changes related to styling are better-done on desktop. With this use-case in mind, this redesign is focused on addressing problems related to editing text. 
        </p> 

        <h3>
          Challenge: Scrolling Through Documents is Inefficient 
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Navigating a full-sized document google docs’ mobile app requires a lot of scrolling, and it’s easy to over-shoot a piece of text.

          With the small text-size, selecting a string of text is difficult. It's easy to select the wrong line of text, select too many characters, or not enough.

          UI and Visual Design Refinement
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          After laying out the basic pages, I explored different UI patterns and visual styles for the different pages. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Hover Menu
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          I explored ways to represent the choices available to users when they select text. In one design I use the standard iOS multiple-choice modal, and in others I use a pop-up menu of choices. For the pop-up menu, I explored a range of icon sizes and colors. I ended up settling on purple icons on a white menu because of how the purple icons popped out more from the screen and connected more strongly to the highlighted text.   
        </p> 
        <img src="images/Selection-Variations.png" class="photo_two" style = "width:100%;margin-right:auto">

        <h3>
          Commenting State
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          A commenting state needed a two main things: it needed to preserve some amount of context of the text being commented on, and it needed to allow the user to write multiple lines of text. With these requirements in mind, I tried different placements and visual styles for the comment box. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Placement of Comment State
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          In Google docs on desktop, the comment box pops up to the right of the text being commented. Unfortunately, on mobile there isn't this space available. In initial designs I placed the comment box directly above the text being commented, but this did not work well when the text box needed to expand. For example, if the box was above the text, it would need to expand upward and that could be disorienting. If the comment box exanded downward, it would cover the text. Then I tried putting the box under the text. Unfortunatly, that meant that the comment box would expand into the space behind the keyboard. For placement, I decided to place the text box on the top of the screen. This worked better because it allowed for more downward expansion than in other designs. 
        </p>
        <img src="images/Comment-State.png" class="photo_two" style = "width:100%;margin-right:auto">
        <h3>
          Colors in Comment State
        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
          To preserve context, the text that is being commented on appears in the comment box. I highlighted this text in a light purple to mirror the color of the selected state in the prior step. For background color, I used the same white as used in the hover menu. For the "Add Comment" button, I used the same purple that was used in icons. By using the purple consistently on action buttons and active state, it helps to reinforce expectations that purple denotes action. Overall, I wanted to use purple and white to reinforce the relationships between similar states and actions.

          Once a paragraph is expanded, it can then be easily edited by clicking into the text or highlighting text. When text is highlighted, it can be styled and bold, italicized, or underlined. Users can also add comments to strings of text. Since the focus of this redesign is on mobile usage, the functionality is limited to simple text editing centered on the content, rather than sophisticated styling.

          Throughout our design process, we ran usability studies. For example, we learned that the horizontal timeline didn’t have the affordance of clicking to reveal the details. To fix this, we changed to a vertical timeline where details are always shown.

          I created this higher fidelity mockup in Sketch, and the click-through mockup is available through InVision.
