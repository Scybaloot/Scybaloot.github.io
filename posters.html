				This bacterial strain was initially isolated for its strong pink color. For this reason, we though it appropriate to incorporate the pink into the poster design. When we brought this poster to a conference, the pink did its job again by catching the attention of people milling about and starting conversations about our work.

				A challenge faced in this poster is that we had many tests and pictures of results from these tests. To show all these results, we had more than ten pictures squeezed into the middle of the poster. However, they were so crowded and small that it was difficult to see the most relevant results. To simplify the poster, we inluded photos of tests that represented the two different outcomes and presented the other results in a table.

			<p>
				When designing this poster, I considered the flow of the reader through the poster. For this  reason, I chose the simple three-collumn approach.
			</p>
			<p>
				I previously noticed that oftentimes when there is a block of text in the middle of a poster underneath the title, the overall poster feel congested. With a mass of text in the middle, the viewer does not have a clear place to settle their eyes. I remedied this with pictures of the cultures, to give the eye a resting place and quickly orient the reader. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To the left and right of the title, I include pictures of fruits so that without reading the poster, one could get an idea of the topic. The images of fruit ground the abstract chemical name: "Octyl Acetate" in their scent, and the images of bacterial cultures tell the reader that this poster is about bacteria. In the rest of the poster, I use figures to break up text and organize whitespace all while conveying key information.
